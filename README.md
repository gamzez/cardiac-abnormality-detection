## Cardiac Abnormality Detection
**A feature-extraction-based classification applied to heart sound records**: spectral-, 
cepstral- and time-domain features of phonocardiogram records are extracted and fed into 
relatively simpler classifiers. Feature selection is done such that only the features that show a 
separation among normal and abnormal heart signals are accumulated for classification.
Logistic regression and ensemble learning based classifiers (Random Forest and AdaBoost) 
are trained and tested.
